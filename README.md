## Middleware Stack
**Authentication:** "Wrap It Before They Hack It"

### Wrap it before they hack it.

Pickle middleware forms a protective layer around your 
application. Each middleware wraps the next, creating 
a thick, secure barrier between the internet and your 
business logic.


## A properly wrapped Pickle
Request → RateLimit → CORS → Auth → RBAC → Validation → Controller

An unwrapped pickle (DO NOT DO THIS):
Request → Controller

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Never deploy an unwrapped pickle. An unwrapped 
> Pickle exposed to the open internet is a liability.
