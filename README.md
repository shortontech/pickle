## Getting Started: Unboxing Your First Pickle

**Authentication:** "Wrap It Before They Hack It"

### Wrap it before they hack it.

Pickle middleware forms a protective layer around your 
application. Each middleware wraps the next, creating 
a thick, secure barrier between the internet and your 
business logic.


## A properly wrapped Pickle
Request → RateLimit → CORS → Auth → RBAC → Validation → Controller

An unwrapped pickle (DO NOT DO THIS):
Request → Controller

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Never deploy an unwrapped pickle. An unwrapped 
> Pickle exposed to the open internet is a liability.

## Testing (Poking Your Pickle):
It's not complicated.

Compile -> Tickle -> Compile -> Pickle.
* Compile the tickler - a generator for generating generators used within Pickle, so that pickle's generators are plain idiomatic .go files.
* Tickle your pickle - this processes the idiomatic Go to store as templates in .go files.
* Then you compile your pickle.
* Whip out your pickle - pickle one of our test apps.

It's so easy. Anyone can play with their pickle.
