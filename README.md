# Pickle 🥒


## Getting Started: Unboxing Your First Pickle

## Middleware Stack
**Authentication:** "Wrap It Before They Hack It"

### Wrap it before they hack it.

Pickle middleware forms a protective layer around your 
application. Each middleware wraps the next, creating 
a thick, secure barrier between the internet and your 
business logic.


## A properly wrapped Pickle
Request → RateLimit → CORS → Auth → RBAC → Validation → Controller

An unwrapped pickle (DO NOT DO THIS):
Request → Controller

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Never deploy an unwrapped pickle. An unwrapped 
> Pickle exposed to the open internet is a liability.

## Testing (Poking Your Pickle):
It's not complicated.

Compile -> Tickle -> Compile -> Pickle.
* Compile the tickler - a generator for generating generators used within Pickle, so that pickle's generators are plain idiomatic .go files.
* Tickle your pickle - this processes the idiomatic Go to store as templates in .go files.
* Then you compile your pickle.
* Whip out your pickle - pickle one of our test apps.
* Squeeze your pickle - run automated tests.

It's so easy. Anyone can enjoy their pickle.

## Contributing (Pickle Enhancement):

## README TODO:
* The squeeze test suite needs to be documented. Have to make sure the pickle isn't oozing. That's bad.
* Empty sections need to be filled.
